- Move Playback into its own Library.
    - Communication via trait. Look at new winit App trait
    - Other direction via channel
    - Build loop to wait on mulitple event channels for AudioManager
        - posibly different behaviour depending on, if the audio stream is running (and therefore sends events)

or
- Decide to convert all samples. (Would have to convert again when switching backends)
- Look into how the timing in Schism works

    - build audio playback / channel type
    - different phases:
        - event processing
        - lock pattern
        - process
- build a good File Loading API / request-responce?
    - usable for Audio and IT files
