- Move Playback into its own Library.
    - Communication via trait. Look at new winit App trait
    - Other direction via channel
    - Build loop to wait on mulitple event channels for AudioManager
        - posibly different behaviour depending on, if the audio stream is running (and therefore sends events)
- Build a good Sample/AudioFile Abstraction that works with all Types
or
- Decide to convert all samples. (Would have to convert again when switching backends)
- Look into how the timing in Schism works
- build a audio callback 
    - build audio playback / channel type
    - assert_no_alloc
    - rinfbuf ?
    - different phases:
        - event processing
        - lock pattern
        - process
- build a good File Loading API / request-responce?
    - usable for Audio and IT files
    - error handling needed
    - maybe switch to something like nom
    - also fuzz this (cargo-fuzz)
- Change the Pattern / Patterns Type.
    - Use ArrayVec
    - investigate some crazy data structures like rope and text editor stuff
- read: https://marabos.nl/atomics/
- add benchmarks for audio (maybe also video):
    - criterion
    - bencher
    - flamegraph
